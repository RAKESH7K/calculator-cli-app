# Command-Line Calculator in Python

This project is a simple calculator that runs in the terminal.  
It allows users to input two numbers and choose an operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

Key features:
- Each operation is defined in a separate function
- Uses input() to take user values
- Runs continuously in a loop until the user decides to exit

This was built as a beginner-level Python project to understand the basics of functions, conditionals, loops, and user interaction.
